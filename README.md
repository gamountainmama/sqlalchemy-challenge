Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

Part 2: Design a Climate App

I designed a Flask API based on the queries from the climate analysis and data exploration.
